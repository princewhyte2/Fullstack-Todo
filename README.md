<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

![video](https://share.vidyard.com/watch/juVLQJWqbC2eEQVzBugr7A?)

- you can watch the demo by clicking the link above
- It's really amazing seeing me write code with with code quality in mind
- Improving application performance for me expecially with http response has moved to another level
- Writing tests for your code is an important part of the development process

### Built With

<!-- This section should list any major frameworks that you built your project using. Here are a few examples.-->

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)

## Features

<!-- List the features of your application or follow the template. Don't share the figma file here :) -->

This application/site was created as a submission to a [JoinSimba](https://dusty-mandible-d31.notion.site/Simba-Coding-challenge-c7f9db1e2a524043974e661d810dc468") challenge and [DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/challenges) challenge. The challenge was to build an application to complete the given user stories.

- Users must be able to add new tasks to their to-do list
- Users must be able to list their tasks in the list
- There must be a way to edit an existing task status and name
- Tasks must have at least two states: Open / Completed
