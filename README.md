Introduce your projects by taking a screenshot or a gif. Try to tell visitors a story about your project by answering:

- Where can I see your demo?
- What was your experience?
- What have you learned/improved?
- Your wisdom? :)

### Built With

<!-- This section should list any major frameworks that you built your project using. Here are a few examples.-->

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Express.js](http://expressjs.com/)

## Features

<!-- List the features of your application or follow the template. Don't share the figma file here :) -->

This application/site was created as a submission to a [JoinSimba](https://dusty-mandible-d31.notion.site/Simba-Coding-challenge-c7f9db1e2a524043974e661d810dc468") challenge and [DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/challenges) challenge. The challenge was to build an application to complete the given user stories.

- Users must be able to add new tasks to their to-do list
- Users must be able to list their tasks in the list
- There must be a way to edit an existing task status and name
- Tasks must have at least two states: Open / Completed

## How To Use

<!-- Example: -->

To clone and run this application, you'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which comes with [npm](http://npmjs.com)) installed on your computer. From your command line:

```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/your-user-name/your-project-name

Here you have two directories:
The todo-app client and the todo-app server.
cd into each directory and run the following commands:
# Install dependencies
$ pnpm install

# Run the app
$ pnpm dev to run the development server
```
